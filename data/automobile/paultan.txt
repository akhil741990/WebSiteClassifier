In Cars, Mercedes-Benz, Spyshots / By Jonathan Lee / 9 November 2018 12:20 pm / 0 comment Us Malaysians may have just received the facelifted W205 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, but Stuttgart is already preparing an all-new model to replace it. Set to be given the W206 codename, the next C-Class has been spotted by our spy photographers in the German city, so the car is well on its way to production to take on the also-new G20 BMW 3 Series. As you’d expect from an early prototype, there’s still plenty of camouflage applied, but there are a few things we can glean from these images. Firstly, the new car appears to be significantly larger than before, especially at the rear of the car – although that could just be the hard disguise on the bootlid fooling us. It’s also clear that the new C-Class will retain the curvaceous Sensual Purity design language that has been around since the W222 S-Class. The sweeping roofline and upswept lower character line along the sides are iterations of the current model, but there’s no longer a hard shoulder line and the headlights appear to be slimmer, just like the new A-Class and CLS. There are wider tail lights as well. There will likely be bigger changes under the skin, with the C-Class gaining all the new technologies from its younger siblings. Our spies claim that the interior will be completely different from the outgoing model’s, with touchscreen controls similar to those in the latest Audi A8 as well as a non-touch upper display – although we believe a version of the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) with a central touchscreen is more likely. Expected to be built on a new version of the Modular Rear Architecture (MRA2), the C-Class should receive the 48-volt electrical system that is also set to go on the new W223 S-Class, which would allow the system to power items like the air-conditioning compressor and the turbocharger. Also on the cards are all the semi-autonomous driving features from the E- and S-Class, such as remote parking. As for engines, the C-Class should inherit the new engines already found on other models. The existing M264 turbocharged four-cylinder petrol introduced on the facelifted W205 will likely soldier on in 1.5 litre mild hybrid (C 200) and regular 2.0 litre (C 300) forms, though a mild hybrid version of the 2.0 litre – fitted to the E 350 and CLS 350 – is also a possibility. Further up the range, the AMG C 43 will be substituted by the C 53, which will finally receive the new 3.0 litre mild hybrid twin-turbo straight-six pushing upwards of 400 hp; the C 63, meanwhile should feature an uprated version of AMG’s trademark 4.0 litre biturbo V8. A brace of new four-cylinder and straight-six diesel mills, as well as next-generation plug-in hybrids with up to 100 km of all-electric range, are also expected.

Let’s start with the most obvious change – design. Up front, the new Triton (known as the L200 in certain markets) wears a significantly bolder look, courtesy of the new Dynamic Shield family face. The bonnet line has also been raised, which helps accentuate the sense of presence. Also new are the slimmer bi-LED headlights with stylish LED daytime running lights. Both units are connected seamlessly to a brand new dual-bar radiator grille. Below that, the halogen fog lamps sit recessed in a protruding housing (much like the Xpander), and two thick chrome strips neatly guide the eye down and towards the side. Completing the frontal revision is a skid plate that’s finished in satin silver, and it features a quartet of air inlets to aid aerodynamic flow. Round the side, the new Triton sits on newly-designed 18-inch wheels, and the rear end gets a swanky pair of LED tail lights. Inside, it gets subtle tweaks in the form of new switchgear and air-conditioning vents. In upping the feel-good factor, soft-touch plastics find their way on to the armrests, floor console and parking brake lever. As before, two engines are being offered – entry-level variants will get the 2.5 litre four-cylinder turbodiesel engine, tuned to produce anywhere from 107 hp and 200 Nm to 134 hp and 324 Nm of torque. Higher-spec models get the latest 4N15 2.4 litre MIVEC turbodiesel mill, producing 179 hp at 3,500 rpm and 430 Nm of torque from 2,500 rpm. Perhaps the biggest change is the inclusion of a new six-speed automatic transmission, which is an upgrade from the existing five-speed INVECS II unit. According to Mitsubishi, the new six-speeder unit offers smoother gearshifts and more powerful acceleration, as well as improved refinement. All 4WD Triton models are fitted with Super-Select 4WD for optimum traction and handling characteristics on all surfaces, as well as Easy-Select 4WD. Both 4×4 systems are said to improve off-road performance. Hill descent control is also available for the first time, although this feature is limited to selected 4WD models. The new 4WD system also features off-road drive modes, such as Gravel, Mud/Snow, Sand and Rock (in 4L only). When engaged, off-road mode integrally controls engine power, transmission and braking to regulate wheel slip, thereby maximising all-terrain performance and traction levels in sticky situations. Meanwhile, the brakes have been beefed up with larger front ventilated discs and calipers, whereas ride quality has improved thanks to larger rear dampers which contain more damping fluids. Now, it may be a pick-up truck, but it’s not shabby when it comes to safety either. The kit list includes forward collision mitigation, blind spot warning, rear cross traffic alert and an ultrasonic misacceleration mitigation system. The last feature helps reduce accidents which result from improper use of the accelerator when moving off or reversing in confined spaces. Also, the top model features a multi around monitor, which offers drivers a 360-degree bird’s eye view of the car’s surroundings when needed. Front parking sensors have also been added. The facelifted Mitsubishi Triton will be launched in Thailand on November 17, following which it will be rolled out to 150 countries around the globe. We’ve been told that the Triton is due to arrive in Malaysia within the first quarter of next year. Ahead of that, Mitsubishi Motors Malaysia (MMM) will be displaying it at the upcoming Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show (KLIMS 2018) from November 23 to December 2, and it’s likely that the order books will open then as well. Alternatively, you may catch the Triton at the following locations as listed above. MMM will also organise a special display for the new Triton in Johor Bahru at a later date.

Keeping things as vague as possible, BMW says the M8 Coupe will be powered by a high-revving V8 with M TwinPower Turbo technology. The exact engine capacity is unknown but we are told that the mill makes 600 PS (591 hp), and will be paired with a fully variable, rear-biased M xDrive all wheel-drive system that can send drive exclusively to the rear wheels in 2WD mode. This setup sounds pretty identical to what you’ll find in the latest F90 M5, which packs a S63B44T4 4.4 litre twin-turbocharged V8 with 600 PS from 5,600 to 6,700 rpm and 750 Nm of torque between 1,800 and 5,600 rpm. In the M8 (and M5 as well), the transmission is an eight-speed M Steptronic torque converter automatic gearbox, with a locking Active M Differential. Unsurprisingly, the M8 get its own specific chassis tuning, which includes a reworking of the double-wishbone front/five-link rear suspension. There’s also a wider front track, while the rear gets bespoke toe links with stiffer rubber mounts, firmer anti-roll bars and more rigid wishbones; electronically controlled dampers are standard. The electromechanical M Servotronic steering is lifted from the M5, although tuned specifically for use in the M8. A selection of driving modes for the powertrain, transmission, suspension and steering will be available as well, allowing the driver to personalise his or her driving experience, which again, is similar to the M5. Stopping power comes in the form of standard M compound brakes, with the front featuring 395 mm discs and six-piston fixed calipers, while 380 mm discs and single-piston floating calipers are used at the rear. An option here are M carbon-ceramic brakes, which bumps the size of the front discs up to 400 mm as well. The brakes sit behind 19-inch M light-alloy wheels, or an optional 20-inch set. Finally, there’s the complete M makeover to distinguish the M8 from a run-of-the-mill 8 Series, including dedicated body components, badging, twin tailpipes and aerodynamic-focused features. The M8 Coupe will also be offered in Convertible (F91) and Gran Coupe (F93) guises later on, although timelines for either models have yet to be provided. 0 comments | Leave a comment?   AXA FlexiDrive – one year on, does telematics motor insurance make a difference in safety and savings? In Advertorial / By Danny Tan / 9 November 2018 10:09 am Slightly more than a year ago, AXA Affin General Insurance launched AXA FlexiDrive, a new kind of motor insurance that uses telematics to track driver habits, encouraging smooth and safe driving in return for discounts on one’s annual insurance premium. With a telematics device in the car, it also promises emergency and vehicle recovery services in the event of accident or theft. One year on, there have been many cases where AXA FlexiDrive has made a difference in the motoring lives of its customers. Wong, who got into an accident, loves the fact that he’s never alone. “I never had an experience where I got a call from the insurance company immediately after an accident. It was very reassuring getting a call from someome to ask if you need help or is there anything they can do for you,” he said. “It’s a very good tool. I always have it on my phone because it helps me with a lot of things – locate my car if anybody breaks in, and on top of that, when an accident happens, I feel so reassured. It’s very comforting, it’s very reliable and I feel very safe with it,” he said of the AXA FlexiDrive app. While Camille had an incident-free year of motoring, she also appreciates the added security AXA FlexiDrive’s 24/7 Vehicle Security & Theft Recovery brings. “As a female driver, it’s always at the back of my mind if anything happens to me on the road. I feel protected 24/7 with AXA FlexiDrive – it ensures safety, security and it also helps me with my driving. I urge all females, you should sign up for AXA FlexiDrive,” she said. If the telematics device detects a heavy impact, such as when an accident occurs, Automatic Accident Alerts & Assistance will be automatically triggered and the 24/7 Secure Operating Centre (SOC) will get in touch to ensure that you receive medical help as soon as possible. The SOC receives real time alerts upon battery disconnection or device sabotage, and will obtain verification from customers. According to AXA, there have been several cases where stolen vehicles were successfully recovered in collaboration with the police. In one theft recovery case, the thieves were arrested. Esther keeps track of her son’s driving habits via the AXA FlexiDrive app. “Safety is my biggest priority when it comes to my children and family. Young drivers tend to drive very fast on the highway when we’re not with them. With AXA FlexiDrive, I can know what’s their driving behaviour, I will be the first to know,” the protective mother said. On her son’s driving, Esther said: “So far he improved la. He will try not to drive so fast. I think all parents should sign up for AXA FlexiDrive to instil good driving behaviour in their children. AXA FlexiDrive tracks and scores your driving behaviour with the telematics device, which measures parameters such as speed, harsh acceleration and braking, as well as mileage. A smooth and measured approach will improve your score; conversely, full throttle traffic light getaways and heavy braking will pull it down. Moderate speeds and mileage will also improve scores. A driver’s score will put him/her in one of three categories: Red (poor driver), Yellow (average) and Green (safe driver). No savings for those in Red, but Yellow and Green drivers get 10% and 20% Safe Driving Discount respectively. The savings will be on your following year’s premiums, on top of your no claims discount (NCD). The discount amount will be banked in to the customer 14 days after the completion of the policy period of 12 months. How about “poor drivers” with “bad habits”? No penalties to the pocket, just personalised driving tips from the app to help you be a safer driver. So, while backroad burners aren’t likely to get much in savings, they won’t be punished either. Rajendra loves the savings aspect of AXA FlexiDrive. “I believe in driving safe, I believe everyone should drive safe. It offers safe driving tips, it gives you feedback on how well you have been driving, or otherwise. I signed up for AXA Flexidrive a year ago and since then I’ve saved RM712. I’m very happy with that. It’s a great way to encourage drivers,” the economical driver said. According to the insurer, AXA FlexiDrive customers are receiving 14% Safe Driving Discount on average. The company is happy that the incentives are helping motorists to be more prudent drivers. By encouraging good driving behaviour, it improves road safety in a country that ranks high in accident and fatality rates. While it’s a new concept now, expect insurers to focus more on the risk profile of motorists moving forward. The phased liberalisation of motor insurance has already started, and in the near future, how much one pays for insurance will no longer be determined by fixed price lists, but by his or her risk profile. This risk-based assessment is already present in many countries, and it “rewards” those who are perceived to be low risk with lower premiums, vice versa. Incentivising consumers to improve their risk profile will also lead to lower claims for insurers, leading to a win-win situation for all. Risk factors could include driving habits, age of the driver, and claims history. Also taken into account are the age and type of the insured vehicle, as well as its safety features. Transport minister Anthony Loke recently said that the ministry was considering a merit system to reward prudent drivers with discounts on vehicle insurance, another sign that usage-based insurance such as AXA FlexiDrive is the future of motor insurance. Get a head-start by signing up for AXA FlexiDrive to enjoy Safe Driving Discount, Automatic Accident Alerts & Assistance and 24/7 Vehicle Security & Theft Recovery. Other benefits include six months repair warranty for all work done at panel workshops, and the ability to monitor your car’s battery status and odometer reading remotely via the AXA FlexiDrive app. AXA FlexiDrive doesn’t cost more than the standard comprehensive motor insurance premium, just a refundable deposit of RM70 for the telematics device is all that’s required.

The interior design of the new Volkswagen Golf-sized model, previewed in a sketch the company released this week, is said to feature a modern and ergonomic design inspired by the Vision RS concept, complete with the latest technologies. In a departure from past Skodas, the Scala features a freestanding display high up on the dashboard, measuring up to 9.2 inches and linked to new infotainment systems based on the latest Modular Infotainment Matrix. The dashboard itself features a “design line” claimed to echo the contours of the car’s bonnet, and which also forms a wrist rest under the display for operating the touchscreen. The cabin also boasts soft-touch materials on the dash and door panels, which incorporates large design textures and a new grain that emulates crystalline structures – said to be part of Skoda’s design language from here on out. Also fitted is ambient lighting in either white or red, while the seat upholstery is offered in warm hues and with contrasting stitching for the seat upholstery, with Suedia microfibre trim also available. As far as space is concerned, Skoda says that the Scala offers a “tremendous amount of space,” thanks to the car’s generous 2,649 mm wheelbase. The company claims a total of 79 mm of knee room at the rear – the same as an Octavia, apparently – and a 467 litre boot that it says is the largest in the segment. With the rear seats folded, this increases to 1,410 litres. Other features include an optional 10.25-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display with five different configurations, plus new Skoda Connect mobile services that allow users to lock and unlock their cars using their smartphone and download map and software updates over the air. Skoda says that all Scalas will be always online, a first for the brand.

Limited to only 11 units, the special edition model will be available exclusively on Lazada in conjunction with the company’s annual 11.11 Shopping Festival on November 11, 2018. The Polo Black & White is priced at RM68,488 on-the-road without insurance, and the price also includes added accessories worth RM7,500. Furthermore, official bank partner Hong Leong Bank will be offering a special interest rate of 1.11% per annum for a five-year loan as part of the deal. To make a booking, you’ll need to fork out an initial fee of RM799, which can be made via Lazada Wallet, credit card or online banking, after which a Volkswagen representative will contact you for further arrangements. What you’ll be getting with the Polo Black & White is a vehicle based on the existing Polo 1.6 Comfortline Vienna (priced at RM74,990), so a 1.6 litre naturally-aspirated four-cylinder petrol (105 PS/153 Nm) drives the front wheels via a six-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic. As the name clearly suggests, the special edition Polo follows a specific theme, with Candy White being the primary and only body colour available. This is accompanied by black touches, including on the rear spoiler, side mouldings, 15-inch ‘Riverside’ alloy wheels and side mirror caps. You’ll also get VW tinting for the money, while the black leather seats and R340G head unit with App-Connect are already standard on the car it is based on. “A consumer’s purchasing journey have evolved so much in the past recent years, and we are pleased to have played a part in changing perceptions to the point where purchasing a car is now the new norm. This is evident with the success with our collaborations with Lazada for the 12.12. Beetle and the recent JOIN range. Convenience aside, this also tells us that consumers are online – reading, researching and looking for the best deals. And that is where Volkswagen will be,” said Erik Winter, managing director of VPCM. “As Malaysia’s leading e-commerce platform, Lazada has evolved beyond being just an online shopping platform and has transformed into a lifestyle destination. Our continued partnership with Volkswagen is proof of changing consumer behaviour, and we look forward to offering our customers the biggest and best Lazada shopping experience through this exclusive collaboration,” added Christophe Lejeune, CEO of Lazada Malaysia. 20 comments | Leave a comment?   2018 EICMA: Royal Enfield shows KX Concept bike In Bikes, International Bike News, Royal Enfield / By Mohan K Ramanujam / 8 November 2018 5:39 pm 3 comments A big surprise and huge deviation in design language happened at the EICMA show in Italy when Indian motorcycle manufacturer Royal Enfield showed the KX Concept motorcycle. Inspired by the classic KX 1140 V-twin motorcycle of the 1930s, Royal Enfield says the KX Concept is a showcase of their design prowess and was completed in a mere six months. Although an interpretation of the classic design, the connection between the KX Concept and its predecessor from 80 years ago can easily be discerned. Cues to the 1930s design can be seen in the wide handlebars, V engine, “floating” single seat, flat-tip exhaust and fuel tank finished in British Racing Green. Royal Enfield did not disclose the engine capacity of the KX but a “838” logo on the engine might be an indication. Exhaust exits on the right side, in the traditional style. A unique touch on the KX Concept is its suspension, with a girder fork – possibly made from aluminium – installed on the front end, and the headlight cowl integrated into the fork covers. At the back is a triangluar single-sided swingarm attached to a shock absorber under the seat. Modern equipment installed on the Royal Enfield KX Concept include disc brakes and rear, clamped by Brembo callipers, with the front wheel being a 19-inch hoop shod in Maxxis DTR-1 rubber. Chain drive gets power to the rear wheel and LED lighting is used throughout, while a circular digital instrument readout is found inside the cockpit. 3 comments | Leave a comment?   New Genesis G90 facelift teased before Nov 27 debut In Cars, Genesis, International News / By Gerard Lye / 8 November 2018 5:23 pm 2 comments Genesis Motors, the luxury vehicle division of the Hyundai Motor Group, has released a teaser of the facelifted Genesis G90 ahead of an official debut on November 27. The flagship model was first introduced in 2015, and is also known as the EQ900 in its native Korea. Underneath the giant cover is the car in question, although you won’t be able to see much of the new car’s styling for obvious reasons. However, the bright LED headlamps indicate a more squarish design compared to the outgoing model, with long, illuminated strips running through the middle acting as the daytime running lights. We can also roughly make out the brand’s trademark hexagonal-shaped grille, which now tapers down more severely towards the bottom, and there is a honeycomb pattern for the mesh instead of horizontal slats in the same breath as the G70 and G80 Sport. A new front bumper is a definite here, which should feature a larger lower intake than before as well. According to an official release, the new G90 will also come with a revised rear, 18-inch wheels (19-inch optional), three new colour combinations, over-the-air update function for the infotainment system, a 12.3-inch touchscreen (also found in the Kia K900), a host of safety and driver assistance systems, and premium interior materials. Engine options include a 3.3 litre T-GDI V6, 3.8 litre GDi and 5.0 litre Tau GDi V8. An eight-speed automatic transmission will likely be the sole pairing partner for the engines, with all-wheel drive available as an option in place of the standard rear-wheel drive.

Along with the announcement, the Japanese automaker also released this teaser image of the C-segment model in both sedan and hatchback body styles. Naturally, there’s very little official information provided here, aside from the fact that the new Mazda 3 will adopt the company’s next-generation SkyActiv-Vehicle Architecture, second-stage Kodo design approach and SkyActiv engines, with the last bit possibly involving its SkyActiv-X compression ignition powerplant. Focusing on hatchback first, the shape you see here is very reminiscent of the Kai Concept from the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show. Much like the earlier teaser posted by Mazda, we still see a rather sizeable C-pillar, chrome trim in the lower half of the side window, slim taillights and a black-painted roof spoiler. All-new Mazda 3 illustrations Meanwhile, the side view of the sedan shows a similar rear door design to the hatch, but we’re unable to get a good look at the taillights and boot section. Referring to previous illustrations, they will likely be two-piece units that closely mimic those of the hatch. You’ll also notice a cue inspired by the Vision Coupe, whereby linear transitions in light and shadow create a “vortex effect” that is seen between the wheels. As for the interior, expect a dialled-down version of the Kai Concept’s design. Looking again at the sketches, the Mazda 3’s main dash is largely uninterrupted, with only an infotainment screen placed in the upper section, accompanied by slim air-con vents and various switchgear beneath. The driver-centric approach sees vents being placed on either sides of the instrument binnacle , which could feature a digital display within. According to Mazda, “the arrival of all-new Mazda 3 marks the beginning of a whole new generation of Mazda cars that will deliver new dimensions of driving pleasure to customers around the world.” Excited? Well, you’ll need to wait a few more weeks before all is revealed.
